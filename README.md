Movie Recommendation System 🍿

Hello there! Have you ever watched a fantastic movie and immediately wondered, "What else might I enjoy?" Well, this recommendation system is designed to guide you to your next favorite film!

This movie recommendation system, written in Python, utilizes the Pandas library to process user ratings and suggest movies based on a given title. By analyzing shared preferences among users in a dataset, it provides a curated list of film recommendations.

It's pretty straightforward and simple, but you can play around with it and adjust stuff! 😉
